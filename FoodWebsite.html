          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            These soft Onion Pakodis are being sold at almost every street
            corner in the Andhra and Rayalaseema regions. Onion Pakodi comes in
            different varieties. Interestingly the ingredients for any type of
            Onion Pakodi may be the same. The difference comes in the way the
            batter is mixed and the way it is fried. These two factors make for
            a world of difference!! The soft Onion Pakodis are crisp on the
            outside and soft at the core. This Melt- in- the- mouth quality
            makes for the delight in eating this Pakodi. Believe me, once you
            begin to eat this Pakodi, there's a non-stop connect between the
            hand and the mouth until the Pakodis are over!!

          <h3>Recipe</h3>
          <p>
            Chop the Onion into thickish pieces. Chop Green Chillies and Ginger
            into fine pieces. Mix all ingredients into chopped Onions. Squeeze
            the onions hard while mixing. When all is well mixed, add water.
            Whisk the batter fast for about 3-4 minutes. Drop small marble
            -sized balls of the batter into hot oil in a Kadai. Don't shake the
            Pakodis for about 2 minutes. Then fry well on all sides on medium
            flame till well -browned. Take out of the Kadai taking care to drain
            out the extra oil. These Pakodis are delicious and are best eaten
            hot.
